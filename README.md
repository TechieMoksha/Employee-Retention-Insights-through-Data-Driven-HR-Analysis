***A complete Employee Attrition Prediction & HR Insights project using Python, Machine Learning, Power BI, and Streamlit.
This system helps HR teams identify why employees leave and predicts who is at risk, giving data-driven recommendations.***

**🚀 Project Overview**

This project performs end-to-end HR analytics using employee data. It includes:

Data cleaning

Exploratory analysis

ML model for attrition prediction

Streamlit dashboard for interactive insights

Power BI dashboard for business-level reporting

The goal is to help organizations improve employee satisfaction and retention strategy.

**⚙️ How This Project Works (Step-by-Step)**


This is the exact way to run the project from your system.

1️⃣ Place All Files in One Folder

Create one main folder and put all project files together:

<img width="524" height="332" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e09d76d-4071-4292-a796-2a0fb1024bab" />


This ensures Streamlit, datasets, and model load without errors.


2️⃣ Install Required Python Libraries.
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib streamlit openpyxl plotly



3️⃣ Run the Streamlit Dashboard.

Use the command:

1. cd "YourFolderPath"
2. python -m streamlit run "YourFinalAppPath"


Streamlit will:

Start a local server
Open the dashboard in your browser
Load dataset + model + visualizations
You will see a fully working web app.


4️⃣ How the System Works Internally

✔️ (a) Loads Clean Dataset

final_employee_retention_powerbi_clean.xlsx
→ Used for charts, EDA, and Power BI

✔️ (b) Loads Trained Machine Learning Model

model.pkl
→ Predicts employee attrition

✔️ (c) Preprocessing Script

train_retention_fixed.py
→ Handles encoding, feature scaling, model preparation

✔️ (d) Visualization Script


final_dash.py
→ Generates charts like:

Attrition by department

Salary vs attrition

Work-life balance

Overtime analysis


✔️ (e) Streamlit Output

Based on user input, the app shows:

Attrition Prediction

Confidence Score

Key drivers (important features)

EDA graphs


**Final Output You Will Get**
✔️ A working Streamlit web app
✔️ Machine learning prediction system
✔️ Interactive EDA dashboard
✔️ Power BI business insights
✔️ Full documentation
✔️ Clean, structured GitHub repository
